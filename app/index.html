				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>Ryan had turned twenty-one years old only three months before his accident.</p>
				<p>He was a loving son, brother, grandson, cousin, and friend. He was a young man full of integrity, kindness, generosity, and had a smile that could melt your heart. He gave so much joy and happiness to our family that we instantly knew we had to continue his legacy with this Foundation.</p>
				<p>Ryan loved the outdoors, his family, and sports. He attended Mountain View High School where he excelled in football. After high school, Ryan played two years of college football for Mesa Community College prior to transferring to Arizona State University. Ryan was a junior at ASU majoring in communications and working two jobs to help out with his college expenses.</p>
				<p>On the day of the accident, Ryan and five friends went to Saguaro Lake for a day of fun in the sun. Nobody could have ever imagined that the day would take such a tragic turn and that Ryan would drown. It was a painful and constant reminder of the dangers of water and the importance of water safety. </p>
				<p>Before Ryan passed away, he wrote a mission statement for one of his college classes. In the mission statement Ryan wrote, "I just want to be a good person, good people are remembered." </p>
				<p>Thank you for visiting this website to help honor his legacy. It gives our family great joy to remember Ryan with his old friends and introduce him to new ones.</p>

				<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				<p>We exist to honor Ryan's memory by making a difference in the lives of others.  </p>
				<p>Childhood drowning is the leading cause of injury-related deaths for children ages 0-5. In 2013, 33 adults and 11 children lost their lives in Arizona due to drowning. Tragically, these deaths could have been prevented with life jackets, proper water barriers, education, and CPR training.</p>
				<p>After the loss of their twenty-one year old son in 2008, the Thomas family created the Ryan Thomas Foundation in hopes of making a difference in the lives of others. Directed and run entirely by volunteers, the Ryan Thomas Foundation aims to contribute all event proceeds to local causes.  Since 2009 the Ryan Thomas Foundation has contributed nearly $80,000 to charitable organizations that educate and promote water safety. Among those organizations are the Drowning Prevention Coalition of Arizona, Cardon Children’s Hospital, Outdoor Experience for All, and Phoenix Children’s Hospital water safety programs. In addition, they have donated nearly 200 life jackets to the Arizona Game and Fish Department to be used by their life jacket and in an effort to raise water awareness at our local lakes.  </p>
				<p>It is our mission in 2014/15 to continue to raise awareness on the dangers around water, both to children and adults. We are holding the <a href="#events">6th Annual Ryan Thomas Foundation Golf Tournament</a> at the Mesa Country Club Saturday, February 21, 2015.</p>
				<p>Thanks to our generous sponsors and attendees, this tournament last year generated almost $22,000 in support of drowning awareness.</p>
				<p>Thank you for your interest in and support of the Ryan Thomas Foundation.</p>
